            <p>
                I am seeking an opportunity as a <strong>Software Developer</strong> where I can
                leverage my five years of experience in IT support, hardware and software
                repair, and virtual server management.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have consistently taken initiative to
                <em>expand my technical skill set</em> and embrace new challenges.
                My hands-on IT background has given me a practical understanding
                of system reliability, troubleshooting, and user needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am especially motivated by organizations that value innovation
                and high-quality software solutions. I am eager to contribute
                my technical skills, attention to detail, and enthusiasm for
                programming to a collaborative development team.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background
                and career goals align with your organization’s needs.
            </p>
